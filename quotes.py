          # MGS1: Bosses
          'ear_pull': 'You know of the World Eskimo-Indian Olympics? '
          'There is an event that I excel at. '
          'It is called the "Ear Pull." It is an event where two opponents pull each other\'s ear '
          'while enduring the harsh cold. It tests spiritual as well as physical strength...\n\n'
          'You want to pull each other\'s ears?',

          'psycho': 'You still don\'t believe me? I will show you my psychokinetic '
          'power. Put your controller on the floor. Put it down as flat as '
          'you can... that\'s good. Now I will move your controller by the '
          'power of my will alone!!',

          'mono_tv': 'Huh? Snake, you\'re not using a stereo TV!? Snake, don\'t worry about it. '
          'There\'s more to being a good person than just having a stereo television. '
          'You can do it just the way you are!',

          # MGS1: Natasha
          'gas_mask': 'You got a Gas Mask. Good. That is a double eye-piece type. Be careful. Unlike the '
          'transparent shield type, it will restrict your field of vision. It is equipped with a voice '
          'emitter, so do not worry about not being heard. The outside is made of reinforced plastic '
          'and the inside is made from an acetate weave. Also the eye pieces are specially treated '
          'so they won\'t fog up. You will be able to stay in a gas-filled area for a long time with that '
          'mask. Use it wisely.',

          # MGS1: Master Miller
          'full_stomach': 'It\'s never a good idea to fight on too full a stomach. It\'ll make you groggy...'
          'maybe even sleepy. You should wait 30 minutes after eating before you play.',

          'drowsy': 'After playing for a long time, you should get some rest too. People\'s reaction speed '
          'is slowest around three o\'clock in the morning, and so is their judgment. '
          'If you\'re feeling drowsy, you should get some sleep.',

          'sneaking': 'Listen, Snake. There\'s a way to walk so that your footsteps won\'t be heard. '
          'I call it stalking. Here\'s how you do it. First, put your weight on the opposite foot that '
          'you\'re going to step with. Then take a step so that your heel makes contact with the ground first. '
          'Then as you slowly lower the tip of your foot to the floor, gradually shift your weight onto that foot. '
          'Use your knees to maintain the subtle balance. Try it. '
          'Another way is to wear your socks over your shoes...',

          # MGS1: Misc.
          'butt': 'You\'ve got a great butt.',


          # Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty
          #

          # MGS2: Bosses
          'fatman': 'Fatman... Supposedly he\'s nicknamed after an atomic bomb, but to '
          'me he\'s just a fat man. Something straight out of a sideshow. If '
          'he even has a bit of spare time, he spends it disassembling and '
          'assembling his Glock, over and over again. He can\'t stand to have '
          'his hands still. He\'s extremely vain about his hands — keeps his '
          'fingers as slender and soft as a woman\'s. They say he\'s always '
          'looking at his hands, giving himself manicures. Be careful of '
          'him.',

          # MGS2: Misc.
          'bathroom': 'Raiden here. I took care of the C4 in Strut C. The ceiling of the '
          'Women\'s Bathroom was set to blow.',

          'philanthropy': 'Don\'t you forget that you\'re a part of "Philanthropy" '
          'now, an anti-Metal Gear organization and officially recognized by the UN.',

          'scissors': 'I hear it\'s amazing when the famous purple stuffed worm in flap-jaw '
          'space with the tuning fork does a raw blink on Hara-kiri Rock. I need scissors! 61!',

          # MGS2: Otatcon
          'classified': 'You know how the technical specs of Metal Gear were sold on the black '
          'market after Shadow Moses? And now every state, group and dotcom has its own version of Metal Gear. '
          'Not exactly a classified weapon for today\'s nuclear powers.',

          'development': 'Why did you get involved in weapons development? A lot of people '
          'will get hurt... even more will die!  I\'m talking about the '
          'destruction of homes and cities... radioactive contamination for '
          'years to come. You of all people should know the horror of '
          'nuclear weapons! You know about our family\'s dark history! Why, '
          'E.E.? Why!?',

          'camera': 'I\'ll explain how to use the camera. That digital camera you have '
          'was specially made to take pictures of the prototype Metal Gear. '
          'When a picture is taken, the screen data is first stored in the '
          'camera\'s internal memory. Then it\'s automatically processed '
          'through various algorithms to protect against tampering. Each '
          'picture is electronically stamped and distinctively encrypted.\n\n '
          'So, in the off chance that someone alters the data during '
          'transmission, we\'ll know immediately.  Oh — there\'s a limit to '
          'the internal memory\'s capacity. If the memory becomes full, '
          'overwrite the pictures you don\'t need anymore. When you\'re ready '
          'to take a shot, use the L1 and R1 buttons to scroll left or right '
          'among the picture previews at the bottom of the screen. Send the '
          'pictures to me when you\'re done. Press the Action button when '
          'you\'re in front of the workstation southeast from there, and the '
          'pictures will be sent to me. Get some good shots!',

          'achilles': 'You know the story about Achilles and Paris? The moral here is something '
          'about his heel? Anyway, even the great and virtually immortal hero Achilles was finally done '
          'in by Paris. Talk about a dangerous city. So don\'t get complacent. The mission '
          'can turn around and get you.',

          'study': 'Do you know the saying "Those who walk a hundred leagues think not that their journey '
          'is half ended until the ninetieth league"? It means '
          'that if you\'re planning to walk that far, you\'d better damn well know how to do '
          'simple arithmetic. Study! Stay in school!',

          'chicken': 'This is my favorite Chinese saying: "Better to be first among roosters than last '
          'among bulls." Of course, the meaning\'s clear: If you have to choose between being a '
          'chicken or a cow, pick the chicken. Cows are always being messed with by aliens — '
          'cattle mutilations are up, you know. Why go looking for trouble, right? If an enemy '
          'spots you, you\'ll be in more trouble than a cow on a UFO. You stay out of their sight!',

          'muskateers': 'Snake, you of course know the saying "One for all, all for one." It\'s '
          'from "The Three Musketeers" — the book, not the candy bar. Anyway, it means that if '
          'you go up against everyone by yourself, they\'ll gang up on you too. I think. Since '
          'you\'re on your own on that ship, you need to take this to heart and avoid '
          'confrontations. How was that? Just like the old days, huh?',

          'greedy': 'There\'s a saying that goes "Even a bird on high dies a '
          'glutton\'s death, as do the fish of The Deeps." The lesson is '
          'don\'t be greedy. The fish that belonged to a family called '
          'the Deeps died from overfeeding, and so did a bird that got high '
          'on something — probably fermented fruit. Don\'t take unnecessary risks just because you\'re '
          'greedy for more Items. Remember the Deep family\'s fish.',

          'help': 'The Chinese have a saying: "Those who are lost never question a '
          'path, and a drowning man doubts not the shallows." And it means '
          'that you need to make use of other people\'s help. '
          'Otherwise, you could be in trouble. If you\'re lost, you don\'t '
          'even know whether a road you come across is a right one, and, uh, '
          'what\'s the difference between shallow and deep if you\'ve already '
          'drowned...right? Anyway, the point is that help is always a good '
          'thing to accept. So make good use of the Codec.',

          # MGS2: Pliskin
          'bandage': 'I see you have the bandage equipped. Whenever you\'re bleeding, '
          'select the bandage in the menu display and press the Confirmation '
          'button to stop the bleeding. The bandage is an absorption pad '
          'made from alginate fiber. As you probably know, when alginate '
          'fibers come into contact with blood or liquids, the colloid gels '
          'to produce a moist condition for speeding up the healing process. '
          'With outstanding absorption properties in terms of speed and '
          'capacity, bandages effectively stop bleeding.',

          'binoculars': 'That pair of binoculars is a high-end military model with '
          'auto-focus and zoom features. The binoculars will be particularly '
          'useful when used outside the "Big Shell." If you can spot an '
          'enemy in the distance at an early stage, it\'ll give you plenty of '
          'time to do something. Scouting out the location of your enemy is '
          'vital to the success of an infiltration mission.',

          'body_armor': 'I see you\'re wearing body armor. That\'s a great way to minimize '
          'damage. Your body armor is interwoven with a special fiber made '
          'from high-performance polymer materials. The special fiber '
          'tangles around a bullet to cushion and spread out the impact to '
          'keep damage at a minimum. Bear in mind that the armor just '
          'reduces damage. It doesn\'t eliminate it.',

          'coolant': 'The coolant spray that you have is great for freezing the C4 set '
          'by Fatman. After you equip the spray, you can discharge the '
          'coolant by pressing the Weapon button. When the coolant is '
          'exposed to the open air, it changes into a gel and adheres to the '
          'C4 and stays at a low temperature. Spray a lot of coolant to '
          'cover the C4 and make sure that it won\'t melt away. This means '
          'that once you coat the C4 with this stuff, you can assume it '
          'won\'t explode. You\'ve got enough there so you don\'t have to worry '
          'about running out. It\'s important to remember that once you equip '
          'yourself with the spray, you won\'t be able to move. If an enemy '
          'approaches while you\'re spraying the coolant, the best thing to '
          'do is put it away and hide. On top of dealing with the C4, you '
          'can use the spray against an enemy. Don\'t forget that.',

          'night_vision': 'Those night vision goggles will let you see in the dark. The '
          'goggles are equipped with an image intensifier that amplifies '
          'even the lowest levels of light to produce clear images. Night '
          'vision devices were introduced in the 1940s. Since then, they\'ve '
          'undergone several modifications to improve both sensitivity and '
          'resolution. Incidentally, the set you\'re using is a '
          'fourth-generation model.',

          'thermal': 'Those Thermal Goggles provide night vision by creating images '
          'from heat distribution. The goggles have a resolution of over '
          '400,000 pixels. This performance is largely attributed to the use '
          'of a two-dimensional solid projection system with outstanding '
          'electric charge transfer capability. With these goggles, you can '
          'probably see Claymore mines that are rendered invisible with '
          'stealth camouflage.  If you look around the necks of enemy '
          'soldiers, you can probably make out their dog tags.',

          'rations': 'You\'ve got rations. Rations are military food provisions capable '
          'of LIFE recovery. Select a ration in the menu display and press '
          'the Confirmation button for LIFE recovery. If you equip yourself '
          'with rations, you can automatically recover LIFE the moment it '
          'hits zero. Field rations are not just emergency food. For a '
          'soldier, it\'s a vital factor in maintaining combat efficiency. '
          'Rations are the result of concentrated research and development '
          'efforts on the part of the U.S. Military\'s Cooking Laboratory. '
          'Together with calories, meticulous attention is focused on '
          'balanced nutrition. Freeze-dried, the rations are easy to carry '
          'and keep well. It ain\'t home cookin\', but it\'ll satisfy your '
          'nutritional needs.',

          'sensor': 'You\'re using your Anti-Personnel Sensor. It vibrates whenever an '
          'enemy is approaching your position. The sensor responds to the '
          'electromagnetic field and heartbeat of life forms. The closer an '
          'enemy, the bigger the vibration. It\'s a useful device. But '
          'remember that if you\'re equipped with the sensor, you won\'t '
          'be able to feel any other vibrations around you. It\'s like '
          'life... You gain something only to lose something else. It\'s up '
          'to you to decide where and when you want to use it.',

          'cardboard_box':
          ['The cardboard box that you have is ideal for fooling your '
           'enemies. It\'s a very important tool for infiltration missions. Of '
           'course. I can\'t begin to count the number of agents whose lives '
           'were saved by a cardboard box...',

           'Look. I\'m not exaggerating when I say the success of your mission '
           'hinges on how you use that cardboard box. But in the end, a '
           'cardboard box is only made of paper. Handle it with care or it '
           'won\'t be of much use to you. Y\'know... I\'ve lost a couple thanks '
           'to you...',

           'Treat your cardboard box with care. Take '
           'care of the box and it\'ll take care of you... Don\'t think of it '
           'as just another box. Treat it with love... Don\'t be rough. Okay?',

           'A cardboard box usually consists of a thin pasteboard with a corrugated paper center. '
           'They are usually made of recycled paper. It was first invented in Europe over a hundred years ago. '
           'It was originally used to absorb one\'s sweat when wearing hats. With the same amount of wood '
           'to make one wooden box, you can make six or seven cardboard boxes. And since it\'s recyclable, '
           'it\'s highly economical. In addition, It is strong and easy to store. That\'s why it\'s widely '
           'used for packing. But to avoid damaging weapons and other delicate instruments when shipping them, '
           'they should be packed in stronger boxes, like... wood or something. Also, the crevices should '
           'be filled with styrofoam to prevent them from moving around.'],

          'smoking':
          ['If you blow the smoke in the direction of the infra-red sensors, you should be able '
           'to see them. That was a good idea bringing the cigarettes. But don\'t smoke too much. Cigarettes '
           'make you weak, in mind and body. They are bad for you. Nuclear weapons, nuclear reactors, '
           'hazardous waste... We\'re constantly being exposed to plutonium and other radioactive materials. '
           'Compared to that, smoking seems not so bad, no?',

           'Those things\'ll stunt your growth and ruin your health. But in the '
           'battlefield, you\'ll find there\'s other uses for those cigarettes '
           'besides smoking. I\'m sure you\'ll figure out how to use \'em when '
           'the time comes...'],
